This was a tutorial that I followed to create a fully responsive website using HTML, CSS, & minimal javascript. Credit to EGATOR on youtube for this amazing tutorial. This was not just used as a copy and paste tutorial for me. I took the time to understand each line of code, how and why it was used, and got a chance to experience building a large CSS project from scratch. <br>

The purpose of this project was to build a multi page, responsive website that is viewable on any sized screen. <br>
There is a large amount of CSS that was used to create this including: flexbox, media queries, transitions, shadows, and more. <br>
The javascript used was mainly event listeners for the FAQ dropdowns as well as a few lines of code for the navbar on mobile.
